# SOD Explorer

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/1267426154.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.20669063)

SOD (Scientific Ocean Drilling) Explorer is a web application and Python
package for retrieving,
depth-registering, and visualizing scientific ocean drilling data from the
Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP), the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP), and the
International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP).

Live application: <https://huggingface.co/spaces/rocknrene/SOD-Explorer>
Source code: <https://github.com/rocknrene/IODP-Data-Explorer>

The block at the top of this file configures the Hugging Face Space and must
not be removed; without it the Space reports a configuration error.

## Statement of need

Sixty years of scientific ocean drilling data are distributed across
several archives with different access methods, vocabularies, and depth
conventions: the LIMS database of the JOIDES Resolution Science Operator
(through LORE), PANGAEA, the legacy DSDP database, and J-CORES for the
Chikyu. Comparing two measurements from the same hole, or the same
measurement from two expeditions, usually requires locating the right
archive, downloading and reformatting tables by hand, and pairing samples
by depth in a spreadsheet.

SOD Explorer selects the archive from the Leg or Expedition number,
retrieves the requested report, and pairs samples from two datasets by
depth within a stated tolerance, restricted to the same hole and depth
scale. Every dataset carries a machine-readable provenance record, and every
export includes the citations the source archives require.

## Features

**Legacy Data view** (one dataset, or two merged by depth)
- Retrieval by Leg/Expedition, Site, Hole, and report type from the
  appropriate archive (see *Data sources*), or file upload.
- A choice between a single dataset and two merged datasets; the dataset B
  and merge controls appear only in merge view.
- Depth-tolerance merge (see *Methods*). The merged view shows either the
  paired samples only (the default) or every sample of A, in the chart, the
  table, and the export.
- Depth plots, a cross-plot of two columns with an autocorrelation-adjusted
  correlation test, a depth plot with two value axes, and depth-window
  means.
- Export as a ZIP archive with `data.csv`, `provenance.json`, and
  `CITATION.txt`.

**Shipboard view** (one uploaded file)
- Readers for CSV, TSV, Excel, LAS, and ZIP (including J-CORES bulk exports),
  with automatic detection of the header row below LIMS metadata rows.
- Multi-track depth log with an optional lithology track, sampling-gap
  shading, comment markers, and core-top ticks; one line per hole.
- Scatter, line, histogram, and a correlation matrix restricted to
  measurement columns (identifier columns such as Core, Section, and
  offsets are excluded).

Explanations of each control are behind the ⓘ button beside its section
label. In the Hole menu, `*` denotes an early DSDP hole drilled before hole
letters were assigned.

Program and platform assignments, and the primary archive for each, follow
the *Scientific Ocean Drilling Legacy Data Access: Quick Start Guide*
(Childress, 2026). The assignments are read from the reference table in
`sod_explorer/data/` (see its README for contents and provenance). Retrieved tables are always re-filtered to the requested Leg,
Site, and Hole, because the services do not filter reliably in every case.

PANGAEA and J-CORES tables identify samples by a label
("177-1090E-8H-3,130") instead of separate columns. Such labels are expanded
into Expedition, Site, Hole, and Core columns when they parse and the Site
exists in the reference table, so that these tables can be grouped by hole
like any other. PANGAEA's "Depth sed" is treated as depth below seafloor
(mbsf).

## Report types

Report types are offered under one generic name across the three programs,
following the cross-program data-type table compiled by L. B. Childress
(Gulf Coast Repository; "SOD Data Types", 2026). The table's sixteen types
marked for inclusion are offered. Biostratigraphy, core description,
operations, and X-ray data types are excluded, and paleomagnetism and
major, minor, and trace elements are deferred pending a decision.

| Category | Generic name | DSDP source | ODP report | IODP LIMS report |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Downhole | Downhole temperature | none listed | Downhole temperature | APCT-3/SET |
| Geochemistry | Carbonates | carbonate and carbon | Carbonates (CARB) | CARB |
| Geochemistry | Gas elements | none listed | Gas Elements (GAS) | GE |
| Geochemistry | Interstitial water | interstitial water | Interstitial Water (IW) | IW |
| Geochemistry | Source rock analysis | PANGAEA (Rock-Eval pyrolysis) | Rock Eval (RE/REVAL) | SRA |
| Physical properties | Compressional strength (penetrometer) | PANGAEA (penetrometer) | Shear Strength (PEN) | PEN |
| Physical properties | Gamma ray attenuation bulk density | gamma ray attenuation | Bulk density (GRA) | GRA |
| Physical properties | Moisture and density | density and porosity | Moisture and Density (MAD) | MAD |
| Physical properties | Natural gamma radiation | none listed | Natural Gamma Radiation (NGR) | NGR |
| Physical properties | P-wave velocity (split-core) | sonic velocity | P-Wave Velocity (PWS, Split-Core System) | PWC, PWB |
| Physical properties | P-wave velocity (logger) | sonic velocity | P-Wave Velocity (PWL, Whole-Core System) | PWL |
| Physical properties | Color reflectance | none listed | Color Reflectance (RSC) | RSC |
| Physical properties | RGB | none listed | Digital Imaging RGB Channels (RGB) | RGB |
| Physical properties | Shear strength (vane) | vane shear | Shear Strength (AVS) | AVS |
| Physical properties | Shear strength (torvane) | vane shear | Shear Strength (TOR) | TOR |
| Physical properties | Thermal conductivity | PANGAEA (thermal conductivity) | Thermal Conductivity (TCON) | TCON |

Notes:

- DSDP sources are categories of the DSDP Data Access application unless
  PANGAEA is named. Where the table lists no DSDP data type, a DSDP request
  returns a message rather than a substitute.
- Split-core P-wave velocity corresponds to two LIMS reports, the caliper
  (PWC) and bayonet (PWB) systems. Both are retrieved and returned in one
  table with a `LIMS report` column that identifies each row.
- ODP reports are listed for reference; ODP data are not yet retrievable
  (see *Known limitations*).

## Methods

### Depth scales

Depth scales are inferred from column headers using the IODP depth-scale
terminology (IODP-MI, 2011). The legacy scales "mbsf" and "mcd" are treated
as CSF-A and CCSF-A, respectively. Axis labels use the column header, so the
scale is always visible; no scale is assumed.

### Depth-tolerance merge (`analysis.merge_by_depth`)

1. If both depth scales are recognized and differ, the merge is refused
   unless the user explicitly allows mixed scales.
2. Depths are converted to meters from the unit in each header (meters are
   assumed, with a warning, when no unit is stated).
3. Pairs are restricted to the same hole. If both datasets are on a
   composite scale (CCSF, mcd), pairs are restricted to the same site
   instead. Without Site/Hole columns, rows are paired on depth alone and a
   warning is recorded.
4. Each A sample is paired with the nearest B sample within the tolerance.
   A warning is recorded if no pair is formed.
5. By default each B sample is used at most once (it is kept for the
   nearest A sample), so that one measurement is not counted several times
   in later statistics.

DSDP headers state no depth scale; DSDP depths are taken to be meters below
seafloor (mbsf), as the program defines them. The merged table begins with
the merge depth (A's depth in meters) and `depth_offset_m` (B depth minus A
depth, empty where no pair was found).

The merge report (pairs formed, duplicates removed, median depth offset,
warnings) is shown in the interface and stored in the export provenance.

### Correlation of downhole series (`analysis.correlate`)

Adjacent downhole samples are not independent, so a conventional Pearson
test understates p-values. SOD Explorer reports Pearson's r with a
t-test and a Fisher-z 95% confidence interval based on an effective sample
size

    n_eff = n (1 - r1x r1y) / (1 + r1x r1y)

where r1x and r1y are the lag-1 autocorrelations of the two series ordered
by depth within each hole (Bretherton et al., 1999). In 2,000 simulated
pairs of independent AR(1) series (phi = 0.85, n = 200), the unadjusted
Pearson test reported p < 0.05 for 43% of pairs and the adjusted test for
4.6%, close to the nominal 5%; the test suite repeats a smaller version of
this check. The approximation assumes AR(1) behavior and roughly uniform
sample spacing.

Two properties that both change monotonically with depth (for example,
through compaction) correlate strongly through the shared trend; their
lag-1 autocorrelations then approach 1, n_eff approaches its lower bound
of 2, and the interface reports that significance cannot be assessed. The
cross-plot offers an option to remove a linear depth trend from each
property (per hole) and correlate the residuals, which tests whether the
deviations from the two trends co-vary.

### Depth-window smoothing (`analysis.depth_window_mean`)

A centered mean over a fixed depth interval, computed separately for each
hole. Because the window is defined in meters rather than rows, its physical
length does not change with sampling density and it does not extend across
gaps wider than the window.

### Sampling gaps, core tops, comment markers

- *Sampling gaps* are intervals wider than a threshold between consecutive
  samples of one hole. They mark missing measurements, not core recovery.
- *Core tops* are the shallowest sampled depth in each core, an
  approximation of the curated core top.
- *Comment markers* flag rows with a non-empty comment field; they are a
  screening aid, not a quality classification.

## Provenance and citation of data

Each dataset in the application carries a provenance record with the
source, request parameters, retrieval time (UTC), source file SHA-256 (for
uploads), depth column and scale, and processing steps. Merged datasets
include the records of both inputs and the merge report. The schema
identifier is `sod-explorer-provenance/1`.

`CITATION.txt` in each export lists the PANGAEA dataset citations (with DOI)
and citation guidance for LIMS and DSDP data (the expedition *Proceedings*
and *Initial Reports* volumes).

## Installation

Python 3.11 or later.

```bash
pip install .            # library and application
pip install ".[dsdp]"    # adds Selenium for DSDP retrieval (also requires Chromium and chromedriver)
```

For an exact reproduction of the tested environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

```bash
python app.py                      # http://localhost:7860
gunicorn app:server -b 0.0.0.0:7860 --workers 1 --threads 8 --timeout 600
```

The server must run as a single process: loaded tables are cached in its
memory and the browser holds only a key for each (see `callbacks.to_store`).
Threads let other requests proceed while a long archive request runs. If the
server restarts, loaded tables are discarded and must be retrieved again.

DSDP retrieval reads the Chromium and chromedriver locations from the
`CHROME_BIN` and `CHROMEDRIVER_PATH` environment variables (defaults
`/usr/bin/chromium` and `/usr/bin/chromedriver`).

## Using the library

```python
from sod_explorer.sources import routing
from sod_explorer.analysis import merge_by_depth, correlate

a = routing.fetch("mad", "362", "U1480", "E").df
b = routing.fetch("pwave", "362", "U1480", "E").df
merged, report = merge_by_depth(a, b, "Depth CSF-A (m)", "Depth CSF-A (m)", tolerance_m=0.02)
print(report.matched, report.warnings)
```

## Testing

```bash
pip install ".[test]"
pytest
```

Network services are replaced by recorded or synthetic responses, so the
suite runs offline. Two further commands make real requests and are run
on demand (or by the `live checks` workflow): `python -m
sod_explorer.sources.check_lore` and `python -m
sod_explorer.sources.check_live`. Continuous integration runs the suite and `ruff` on
Python 3.11 to 3.13 (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`).

## Known limitations

- ODP data are read from the NOAA NCEI archive one Hole at a time. The file
  layout was verified on Leg 204, Hole 1244C; other Legs are assumed to
  follow it. The layout of IODP Expeditions 301 to 312 in the archive has
  not been verified, so these may still require file upload.
- Sites and holes for Expeditions 380, 389, and 405 are not yet in the
  reference table; these expeditions can be selected, but only with Site and
  Hole left blank.
- LORE assembles three reports in the browser from an internal report:
  carbonates, interstitial water, and gas elements. This software assembles
  them in the same way, following LORE's report definitions, but does not
  round values and keeps replicate measurements on separate rows, so a
  table can differ in layout from the one LORE displays.
- PANGAEA datasets under moratorium require a login and cannot be retrieved;
  the application reports this and asks for another dataset or a file upload.
- DSDP retrieval automates the DSDP Data Access web application (used with
  its maintainer's permission) and will fail if its page layout changes.
- The merge pairs nearest samples; it does not interpolate.
- RGB data must be requested for a Site or Hole, and a request returning more
  than 300,000 rows is refused; the limit is applied after download, since
  the archives do not report a row count in advance.
- The data table shows the first 5,000 rows; exports contain all rows.
- The Shipboard tab has not been fully tested.
- The effective-sample-size correction is an approximation (see *Methods*).
