"""Static reference table of drilled Expedition/Site/Hole combinations.

The table (``data/exp_site_hole.csv``) lists every Leg or Expedition, Site,
and Hole in the reference compilation together with the scientific program
(DSDP, ODP, IODP) and drilling platform (Glomar Challenger, JOIDES
Resolution, Chikyu, or Mission-Specific Platform, MSP). It populates the
selection menus so that only combinations that were actually drilled can be
requested, and it determines which data source is queried for a request
(see :mod:`sod_explorer.sources.routing`).

Provenance of the table (compilation source and snapshot date) is recorded
in ``data/README.md``.

Conventions
-----------
* All identifiers are stored as strings. Expedition identifiers may carry a
  letter suffix (e.g. ``343T`` for a transit expedition, ``395C`` for a
  complementary expedition), so they are not purely numeric.
* A Hole value of ``*`` denotes an early DSDP hole drilled before hole
  letters were assigned; it is a placeholder, not a hole designation, and is
  never sent to a data service as a filter value.
* An Expedition may be listed with empty Site and Hole values when its
  platform is known but its holes have not yet been entered. It can then be
  selected and routed to the correct archive, with Site and Hole left blank.
